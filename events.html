               <ul>
                   <li><P> Although the capital of Italy is known for its delicious restaurants, beautiful architecture, stellar beaches and a brilliant shopping scene, the best events in Rome are exciting happenings worth travelling to Europe all on their own for. Bringing tourists and locals out together into town piazzas, gardens and cultural venues, these annual festivities function as deep-dives into a slice of culture that, usually, only Romans get to experience.
What to expect? Given the proximity to Vatican City, it is no surprise that many religious holidays are marked by elaborate celebrations that draw visitors from abroad, while neighbourhoods put on smaller events to commemorate patron saints or historic events. Not to forget are the wonderful culinary festivals that celebrate the country’s renowned cuisine, including Taste of Roma, a giant food fest where patrons get to sample both established chefs' and emerging cooks' fare.
From film and fashion to music and enology, our roundup of this year’s very best events in Rome leaves no interest untackled.</P></li>

<h3>4. Cortili Aperti</h3>

<p>When: May</p> 

<p>Italy's dimore storiche, or historic homes, are some of the most fascinating cultural attractions in the country. These extravagant villas, castles and palaces are private residences that open their doors to the public infrequently so, when you have a chance to step inside, you should go. This year, Rome’s most opulent homes will open their leafy courtyards in May during free, guided tours. This event is a wonderful opportunity to see a hidden side of the city and admire cultural heritage in its original setting.</p>

<h3>5. Ides of March</h3>

<p>When: March</p>

<p>Each year on March 15, or the Ides of March, Rome marks the anniversary of Julius Caesar’s untimely death with a period reenactment. Caesar was one of Rome's most important dictators and he was murdered by his own senators during a meeting in 44 BC near the Largo Argentina archeological site. This unique event sees dozens of actors and actresses dress up in Roman togas and engage in animated discussions before dealing Julius Caesar the final blow.</p>
